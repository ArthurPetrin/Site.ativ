            <h2>Artigo</h2>
            <p>
                Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding<br>
                Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group<br>
                which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, <br>
                this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP <br>
                and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, <br>
                there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily <br>
                have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, <br>
                Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy <br>
                for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from <br>
                fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, <br>
                if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. <br>
                Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still <br>
                come for more <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Relatable LXIX</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. <br>
                This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. <br>
                Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, <br>
                Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, <br>
                which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. <br>
                I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, <br> 
                but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis <br>
                that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. <br>
                And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. <br>
                I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. <br>
                Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. <br>
                I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, <br>
                Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. <br>
                Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, <br>
                and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. <br>
                Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, <br>
                he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, <br>
                and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. <br>
                I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, <br>
                and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, <br>
                had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. <br>
                I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. <br> 
                I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope <br>
                that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.<br>
